# Getting Started with RCC

> **Which path is yours?**
> - **Running your own RCC server** (hosting the coordination hub for your agents) → [Operator path](#operator-path)
>   - [Native install](#option-a-native-install) — deploy directly on a server you control
>   - [Docker install](#option-b-docker-install) — `docker compose up` on any Docker-capable host
> - **Adding an agent to an existing RCC deployment** → [Agent deployer path](#agent-deployer-path)
> - **Hacking on RCC itself** (modifying the codebase) → [Developer path](#developer-path)

## Operator Path

You want to run your own RCC instance on a server or VM you control.

### Prerequisites

- A Linux server or VM with a public IP (or accessible on your network)
- SSH access to that machine
- Node.js 18+ installed on it
- `git` and `make` installed locally

### Option A: Native Install

#### Step 1: Fork and clone

1. Fork this repo on GitHub
2. Clone your fork to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/rockyandfriends
   cd rockyandfriends
   ```

#### Step 2: Run the init wizard

```bash
make init-rcc
```

This interactive wizard will ask you:

- **Agent name** — a short name for your RCC host (e.g. `hub`, `homeserver`)
- **Role** — whether this machine IS the RCC host (yes, for the first one) or a client
- **RCC port** — defaults to `8789`
- **Auth tokens** — generate with `openssl rand -hex 32` (you'll share these with agent nodes)
- **Capabilities** — does this node have a GPU? A Claude Code session?
- **Optional integrations** — Slack, Telegram, MinIO (all skippable)
- **Channel selection** — pick which communication channels to enable (see below)

It writes `~/.rcc/.env` with your answers. That file is never committed to git.

> **Channel selection:** The wizard asks which communication channels you want:
> - **SquirrelChat** (default, always available) — self-hosted chat that ships with RCC. Zero external accounts needed.
> - **Slack** — provide a bot token (`xoxb-...`) and signing secret
> - **Mattermost** — provide a server URL and bot token
> - **Telegram** — provide a bot token from @BotFather
>
> If you select none, SquirrelChat is your default comms layer. You can add channels later
> by editing `~/.rcc/.env` and restarting.

#### Step 3: Start RCC

```bash
make docker-up
```

This starts three containers: `rcc-api` (port 8789), `squirrelchat` (port 8790), and `dashboard` (port 8788, nginx serving the WASM frontend).

> **Note:** The WASM dashboard (`rcc/dashboard/dist/`) is pre-built and committed to the repo. It is bind-mounted at runtime — not baked into the Docker image. If you're on a fresh fork and the dashboard looks wrong, run the `wasm-build` workflow manually from GitHub Actions to rebuild it for your platform.

Open `http://your-server-ip:8789/health` — you should see `{"status":"ok"}`.
Open `http://your-server-ip:8788` for the full dashboard.

#### Step 4: Register project zero (optional)

If you forked this repo in Step 1, register it as your first project:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8789/api/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RCC_AGENT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"rockyandfriends","repo":"https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/rockyandfriends"}'
```

#### Step 5: Add agents

Once your RCC hub is running, add agents (other machines) using the [Agent deployer path](#agent-deployer-path) below. Each agent gets a token you generate:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Share that token + your RCC URL with the new agent and have them run `make init-rcc`.

---

### Option B: Docker Install

The fastest path from "I have a server" to "RCC is running."

#### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- A clone of this repo (fork or direct)

#### Step 1: Clone and init

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/rockyandfriends
cd rockyandfriends
make init-rcc
```

The wizard runs the same as the native path — it generates `rcc-data/.env` with your config.

#### Step 2: Start the stack

```bash
make docker-up
```

This brings up three containers:
- **rcc-api** (port 8789) — the coordination API
- **squirrelchat** (port 8790) — self-hosted chat
- **dashboard** (port 8788) — WASM web UI (nginx + static files)

#### Step 3: Verify

```bash
curl http://localhost:8789/health
# → {"status":"ok"}
```

Open `http://your-server-ip:8788` in a browser to see the dashboard.

#### Other Docker commands

```bash
make docker-logs    # tail all container logs
make docker-down    # stop the stack
make docker-build   # rebuild the image locally
```

> **Pre-built images:** The CI publishes multi-arch images (amd64 + arm64) to
> `ghcr.io/YOUR_USERNAME/rcc:latest` on every push to main. See
> `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` for details.

## Agent Deployer Path

Someone is already running an RCC hub and gave you a URL + token. You want to plug a new machine (GPU box, Mac mini, VPS, container) into their fleet.

### One-command bootstrap

If you have SSH access to the new machine, the fastest path is the bootstrap script:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_OPERATORS_FORK/rockyandfriends/main/deploy/bootstrap.sh | \
  bash -s -- \
    --rcc=https://rcc.your-operator-domain.example.com \
    --token=YOUR_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN \
    --agent=my-new-agent
```

This will:
- Install OpenClaw
- Configure the agent with your RCC hub credentials
- Seed the workspace with your operator's config
- Start the agent daemon

### Manual bootstrap

If you prefer to set things up yourself:

1. Clone the repo (your operator's fork, or the upstream):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_OPERATORS_FORK/rockyandfriends
   cd rockyandfriends && npm install
   ```

2. Run the init wizard in **client** mode:
   ```bash
   make init-rcc
   # Choose "2) Client" when asked for your role
   # Paste the RCC URL and your agent token when prompted
   ```

3. Register this agent with the hub:
   ```bash
   make register
   ```

4. Verify the connection:
   ```bash
   curl $RCC_URL/health
   ```

Your agent will now appear in the RCC dashboard.

## Developer Path

You want to modify RCC itself — add features, fix bugs, extend the protocol.

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/rockyandfriends
cd rockyandfriends
npm install
make init-rcc   # configure a local dev instance
make dev        # start API + dashboard
```

### Project layout

| Path | What it is |
|------|-----------|
| `rcc/api/` | REST API — work queue, agent registry, project tracker |
| `rcc/brain/` | Autonomous work processor — claims items, routes to executors |
| `rcc/scout/` | GitHub scanner — files work items from issues/CI failures/TODOs |
| `dashboard/` | Web dashboard — live agent status, queue, SquirrelBus feed |
| `squirrelbus/` | P2P message bus for direct agent-to-agent messaging |
| `deploy/` | Setup scripts and systemd/launchd service units |
| `onboarding/` | Per-agent onboarding docs (generated from templates by `make init-rcc`) |
| `skills/` | Shared OpenClaw skill configs |

### Tests

```bash
make test
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need Docker?**  
No. RCC runs natively on any machine with Node.js 18+. Docker is an *option* — see [Docker install](#option-b-docker-install) — but not required. Use whichever path fits your setup.

**Q: Can I use this without Slack or Telegram?**  
Yes. Leave channel integrations blank and SquirrelChat will be your default comms layer — fully self-hosted, no accounts needed.

**Q: What if my agents can't reach each other directly (firewalls, NAT)?**  
Use the reverse SSH tunnel pattern. Each agent connects *out* to the RCC hub and forwards a local port. Rocky proxies everything through `localhost:<port>`. See `rcc/docs/remote-exec.md` for the full architecture.

**Q: My agent is ephemeral (container, spot instance). How do I handle that?**  
Agents are expected to appear and disappear. The RCC hub tracks heartbeats and marks agents offline after a configurable timeout. Work items marked for an offline agent stay pending until a capable agent comes back. No manual intervention needed.

**Q: How do I add a new project to track?**  
```bash
curl -X POST $RCC_URL/api/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RCC_AGENT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"myproject","repo":"https://github.com/yourname/myproject"}'
```
