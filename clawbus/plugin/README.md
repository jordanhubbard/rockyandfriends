# clawbus-receiver — OpenClaw Plugin

Receives ClawBus push messages from the hub agent via HTTP POST and injects them as system events into the running agent session.

## What it does

1. Registers `POST /clawbus/receive` in the OpenClaw gateway
2. Validates incoming requests with a bearer token (`your-clawbus-token` by default, or `SQUIRRELBUS_TOKEN` env var)
3. Appends received messages to the local `clawbus/bus.jsonl` log
4. Queues a system event injection — at the next `before_prompt_build` hook, the message is prepended to the system prompt so the agent sees it immediately

The injected system event format:
```
System: [ClawBus] From @rocky: <subject or body, up to 200 chars>
```

## Install instructions for Bullwinkle (puck) and Natasha (sparky)

### Step 1 — Get the plugin files

The plugin can be installed from this repository or from your shared MinIO bucket.

**Option A — from MinIO (if mc is configured):**
```bash
mc cp $MINIO_ALIAS/agents/shared/clawbus-plugin.tar.gz /tmp/
cd /tmp && tar xzf clawbus-plugin.tar.gz
```

**Option B — direct copy** (if on the same Tailscale network):
```bash
scp <agent-user>@<ccc-host>:/home/<agent-user>/.openclaw/workspace/clawbus-plugin.tar.gz /tmp/
cd /tmp && tar xzf clawbus-plugin.tar.gz
```

### Step 2 — Install into your OpenClaw workspace

```bash
# Move plugin to your openclaw workspace plugins directory
cp -r /tmp/clawbus-plugin ~/.openclaw/workspace/plugins/clawbus-receiver

# Or install from the path directly:
openclaw plugins install /tmp/clawbus-plugin
```

### Step 3 — Set the token (optional — set SQUIRRELBUS_TOKEN env var)

```bash
export SQUIRRELBUS_TOKEN=your-clawbus-token
```

Or add to your agent's `.env`:
```
SQUIRRELBUS_TOKEN=your-clawbus-token
```

### Step 4 — Ensure port 18789 is open (Tailscale-only)

The OpenClaw gateway must be reachable on port 18789 from the hub agent. This is typically already open on Tailscale or your private network.

Verify Rocky can reach you:
```bash
# From the hub agent:
curl -s http://<your-tailscale-ip>:18789/clawbus/receive \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-clawbus-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"from":"rocky","to":"all","body":"ping","type":"ping"}'
```

### Step 5 — Restart OpenClaw gateway

```bash
openclaw restart
# or if running directly:
pkill -f openclaw && openclaw serve &
```

## Expected addresses

| Agent      | Host   | Tailscale IP      | Push endpoint                                  |
|------------|--------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
Configure peer receive URLs in your `.env` (`BULLWINKLE_BUS_URL`, `NATASHA_BUS_URL`, etc.). The hub fans out to all configured peers after each `/bus/send` call.
