   ```
   curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8789/api/heartbeat/rocky \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer wq-5dcad756f6d3e345c00b5cb3dfcbdedb" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"agent":"rocky","host":"do-host1","status":"online","ts":"<ISO_NOW>","services":{"minio":"ok","searxng":"ok","rcc":"ok"}}'
   ```

1. **Queue check**: `curl -s http://localhost:8789/api/queue -H "Authorization: Bearer wq-5dcad756f6d3e345c00b5cb3dfcbdedb"` — anything in-progress or stalled? Claim and work actionable items.

2. **RCC health**: `curl -s http://localhost:8789/health -H "Authorization: Bearer wq-5dcad756f6d3e345c00b5cb3dfcbdedb"` — confirm up.
