# dangerous-command-guard.sh — PreToolUse safety hook for RCC agents
#
# Adapted from instar's "Security Through Identity" model
# (https://github.com/JKHeadley/instar — dangerous-command-guard.sh)
# Original: Level 1/2 hook with self-verification for Claude Code.
#
# Adapted for Rocky & Friends agent ecosystem (2026-03-27):
#   - Works with OpenClaw + Claude Code on all agent hosts
#   - Config reads from ~/.rcc/.env (RCC_SAFETY_LEVEL) or agent's
#     .openclaw/openclaw.json (agents.hooks.safetyLevel)
#   - Identity context from the agent's IDENTITY.md or SOUL.md
#   - Always-block list includes our learned incidents
#   - Audit trail appended to ~/.rcc/logs/guard.jsonl
#
# Safety Levels:
#   Level 1 (default): Block risky commands, require user authorization.
#     → Safe starting point. Human stays in the loop.
#   Level 2 (autonomous): Inject self-verification prompt instead of blocking.
#     → Agent reasons about correctness before proceeding.
#     → Catastrophic commands are ALWAYS blocked regardless of level.
#
# Install:
#   Claude Code: Add to .claude/settings.json hooks.preToolUse
#   OpenClaw: Wire into elevated exec policy
#
# The Level 1→2 progression is the path to autonomy. Structure > willpower.
